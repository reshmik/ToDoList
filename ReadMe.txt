The todolist folder contains my actual rails project and the data is the folder which is taken from the C:\Program 
Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0 , which contains my table data. 


My assignment can be seen on: 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/todolist_charts

This assignment is a basic todo assignment which does:

    * Create tasks and add them to the to-do list
    * Display the tasks on the list
    * Modify tasks on the list
    * Mark a task as completed
    * Delete an individual task
    * Delete all completed tasks

If u give a taskname, which already exists, it gives you an error and prompts you to go back.
